Case Study
As part of the Maven Hospital Challenge, this project acts as an analytics consulting solution for Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). It delivers a high-level KPI report designed for the executive team, drawn from a subset of patient records. The report provides insights into the hospitalâ€™s recent performance by answering these key questions:

How many patients have been admitted or readmitted over time?

What is the average length of patient stays?

What is the average cost per visit?

How many procedures are covered by insurance?

The dashboard is designed to scale as new data becomes available, while summarizing impactful insights from the current dataset.

Dataset Description
The dataset includes several core observations:

Encounters
Unique identifier for each encounter.

Start and stop dates/times (ISO 8601 UTC).
